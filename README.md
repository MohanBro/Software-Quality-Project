This repository reflects a systematic Software Quality Management model used in Zoom Video Communications that is a cloud-based video conferencing platform. The project aims at the control of major quality features according to ISO /IEC 25010 such as quality security, reliability, performance efficiency, usability, and maintainability. With such a large scale deployment and fast growth, it is important to ensure secure communication, constant availability, and stable functioning of Zoom.   

All defects, risks, and improvement activities are captured with the help of GitHub Issues and undergo a project workflow in terms of project board (To Do -> In Progress -> Review -> Done). This is a tool that replicates a formal quality governance process, in that, it provides traceability between quality attributes, defects and risk-mitigating activities.

## Traceability Matrix

| Quality Attribute | Related Issues |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Security | #1, #2, #3, #7 |
| Performance Efficiency | #4 |
| Reliability | #5 |
| Usability | #6 |
| Maintainability | #8, #9 |
